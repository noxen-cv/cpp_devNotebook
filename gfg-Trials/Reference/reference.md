 A reference in C++ is a variable that acts as an alias for another variable. It is created by using the ampersand (&) symbol during declaration. Once a reference is initialized, it cannot be changed to refer to another variable.
 
 Key Properties of References:
* Must Be Initialized: A reference must be assigned a valid variable at the time of declaration.
* Cannot Be NULL: References cannot hold NULL values; they must always refer to a valid variable.
* Cannot Be Changed: After initialization, a reference cannot be made to refer to a different variable.


    ** a reference (&) is not a datatype â€” it is a qualifier or alias, not a type itself. **
