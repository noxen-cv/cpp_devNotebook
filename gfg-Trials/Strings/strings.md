# Stirngs in CPP

    - a sequence of characters.

## Why Strings Are Special
- Small Character Set:
- Separator-Free Representation
- Internal Presentation (Characters like 'A' to 'Z' are mapped to integer values 65 to 90. etc)


## Types of Strings in C+
- C - Style Srings (char str[] = "hello"; | char str[] = {h,e,l,l,o,\0})
- C++ String Class
